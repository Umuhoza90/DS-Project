# DS-Project Problem statement :

Our aim is to recognize the critical importance of leveraging data-driven approaches to enable early detection of diabetes. Timely identification of individuals at risk or with undiagnosed conditions is key in preventing complications, optimizing treatment outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs. By applying advanced statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and predictive modeling techniques to large-scale healthcare datasets, we can uncover patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes development. Our goal is to develop a robust predictive model that enables early identification of high-risk individuals. Additionally, data visualization techniques can empower healthcare professionals to efficiently identify high-risk populations and implement targeted interventions. By harnessing the power of data science, we can enhance early detection strategies, improve diagnostic accuracy, and contribute to the prevention and effective management of diabetes, improving overall health outcomes for individuals and the broader population.
# About DATA

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) represents a collaborative effort involving all U.S. states, participating territories, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

BRFSS's primary mission is to gather consistent, state-specific data pertaining to health risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, healthcare accessibility, and the utilization of preventive health services associated with the primary causes of mortality and disability in the United States. BRFSS administers surveys to individuals aged 18 and above via both landline and mobile phones.

In 2015, BRFSS examined various critical aspects, including health status and the number of healthy days, physical activity, sleep adequacy, chronic health conditions, oral health, tobacco consumption, diabetes screenings, and the availability of healthcare services.
